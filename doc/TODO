 - Add support for overriding defaults. Will require 
   org.freedesktop.policykit.grant

 - On every polkit_context_is_[caller|session]_authorized we load
   all .policy XML files. This is bad. Dave Jones will kill us. 
   We should

   1. Suggest that a single .policy file only contains actions
      with a given name space com.example.MyApp. We do this
      by printing a big fat WARNING in polkit-policy-file-validate(1)
      if it isn't the case.

   2. We make the policy cache smart and look for the right .policy
      file when called from the is_*_authorized path. If it aint there
      or if it doesn't contain the given action we load all the
      .policy XML files.

   3. When we break ABI (for 1.0 or sooner) we turn the WARNING
      from 1. into an ERROR and drop the "Load all XML files"
      from the is_*_authorized path. Of course, other paths
      (iterate over all declared actions; find action by
      annotation) will still need to load the bulk of the files.
      But normally only polkit-auth(1) and polkit-action(1)
      and other management tools will ever do this.

 - Write an extensive test suite

 - Finish up documentation; in particular how results from
   config files, defaults and authorizations play together

 - Potentially drop the glib dependency (it's not visible in the
   external API). This is mainly to be able to handle OOM for
   mechanisms that will need this (such as dbus-daemon)

 - add support for additional <match> attributes
   in /etc/PolicyKit/PolicyKit.conf

   - <match timeofday="0900-1700">
     Matches 9am through 5pm local time

   - <match weekday="Mon-Fri">
     Matches only on Monday->Friday both inclusive

   - <match selinux_context="regexp">
     Match on caller's SELinux context

   - <match caller_exe="regexp">
     Matches the path of the executable the caller stems from

   - <match group="regexp">
     Match on group

   - <match session_active="true|false">
     Only if the caller is in an active session (or not)

   - <match seat_local="true|false">
     Only if the caller is on a local seat (or not)

   ... And of course the we need the ULTIMATE copout

   - <match run_program="">
     Run a program to make the decision; details are exported in the
     environment. Program cannot assume to run as root or in a specific
     security context; it will need to use a helper a'la
     pam_unix_password.so

 - Reconsider adding k/v dictionaries to Actions; e.g. the Mechanism for
   dial-up networking can attach the key/value pair

     "phone_number" -> "555-123-4567"

   The is a bit like Objects mentioned in the spec (and what we used
   to have as PolKitResource) but a bit more blurry. It may just work.

 - Go to 1.0 soon
