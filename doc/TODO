DONE

 - Write up a nice spec about how all this works since it can be a bit
   confusing

 - Refine the .privilege file format so e.g. user 'foo' is always
   allowed to grant privilege 'bar' to other users. Also other stuff.

 - write polkit-revoke-privilege

 - make polkit-list-privileges and polkit-is-privileged display if a
   privilege is granted permanently or temporary. Also display if it's
   confined to a certain D-BUS connection.

 - Factor out auth code in polkit-is-privileged into a GObject and put
   it in a libpolkit-gobject library (since the interaction is pretty
   hairy (see interaction diagram in polkitd/polkit-session.c) I will
   not put this in libpolkit as I want to use the glib bindings and
   these require the glib main loop => not suitable for Qt etc.)

PENDING

 - Make polkitd emit signals on an interface such that privileged apps
   can be notified when privileges are granted and revoked. Also
   export other useful query operations.

 - make D-BUS interface in general and polkit-grant-privilege in
   particular capable of granting privs permanently

 - write some man pages

 - write libpolkit-gnome that GNOME apps can consume

 - implement D-BUS interfaces suitable for a GUI privilege editor

 - write more tests; audit code
