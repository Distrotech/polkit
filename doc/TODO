 - Have someone review the external API

 - Verify the security model

 - Audit all code; especially the setgid helper

 - Completely rework the lower layer that reads machine-local
   configuration; right now we have the notion of PolicyKit modules;
   am almost certain that needs to go. Especially in the light of the
   fact that we no longer care about Objects/PolKitResource. Probably
   some simple XML will do; no need to load .so files I think. Keep
   It Simple.

 - Granted privileges are currently world-visible; see
   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=244941
   for details. This may just be a Fedora-ism. Alternatively, depending
   on what the FHS says, punt it to the distros and ask them to clean
   up the directories during boot?

 - Add missing details to the spec document
   - provide some real world examples e.g. how the example from
     the PolicyKit-gnome app works. Preferably in tutorial form.
   - more detailed description of the internals, e.g. the dirs
     /var/lib/PolicyKit and /var/run/PolicyKit

 - Clean up all man pages

 - Polish the commandline tools (especially polkit-list-actions could
   be nicer)

 - Make sure API coverage is 100%

 - Have support for systems that don't use the root account; e.g.
   instead of authenticating as root, authenticate any user in
   e.g. the 'wheel' group. Probably means we need a combobox in the UI
   bits (e.g. PolicyKit-gnome + friends) for selecting the user to
   auth as.

 - Go to 1.0 soon

 - Potentially drop the glib dependency (it's not visible in the
   external API)
