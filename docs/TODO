Core TODO items
---------------

 - trawl through all TODO's in code and update this file

 - document the D-Bus interfaces
   - should be done in eggdbus; e.g.
     - D-Bus XML --(eggdbus-binding-tool)--> DocBook --(gtk-doc)--> HTML

 - properly document the GObject API

 - maybe rename .policy to .action for policy XML files

 - provide a polkit-validate-action-file-1 tool to check/validate
   .policy/.action XML files

 - write a couple of introductory sections detailing the system architecture for
   - a developer-audience; and
   - a system administrator audience

 - write a PolicyKit 0.9.x -> polkit 1.0 porting guide

 - provide a public ObtainAuthorization() method

 - separate core API (e.g. CheckAuthorization()) from the administration API
   (e.g. AddAuthorization()) both in the D-Bus interface and in the GObject
   client libraries

 - guard off administration API with I_KNOW_THIS_API_IS_SUBJECT_TO_CHANGE_ETC

 - guard off backend API with I_KNOW_THIS_API_IS_SUBJECT_TO_CHANGE_ETC

 - provide a way to tweak the defaults for actions (or maybe not)

 - do we need negative authorizations? If so, implement code for it, otherwise
   remove it from the PolkitAuthorization class

 - make sure simple operations work when no system bus is present
   - e.g. %post RPM scripts adding/removing authorizations to identities

 - rework the classes in the PolkitAgent* library so the API is easier to
   work with

 - for administrator authentication, make it possible to use 'wheel' group
   sudo-style authentication (e.g. select one or more identities that the
   user can choose to authenticate as)

 - emit a Changed() signal on the Authority interface when authorizations
   change

Backend TODO items
------------------

 - use a GIO extension point to decide what authority backend to use

 - check / validate all incoming arguments
   - and other security/paranoia stuff

 - local files authority backend
   - split out AuthorizationStore into separate class
   - split out AuthenticationAgent and AuthenticationSession to separate classes

polkit-gnome TODO items
-----------------------

 - show a notification icon when the session/user has temporary authorizations
   - along with an option to give these up

 - make the AuthenticationAgent process (which runs for the lifetime of the
   session) spawn a process to display the authentication dialog
   - to make it lighter on resource usage
   - to work around Metacity focus stealing prevention bugs

 - port libpolkit-gnome to new API

 - port polkit-gnome-authorization to new API
